Data Mesh Architecture
    - Decentralized data management (each team handles their own data), 
        centralized governance (universal policies, security control, access mgmt)
    - domain ownership of data (sales team owns sales data, finance team owns financial data, and so on)
    - treating data as a product for others to consume

*IBM*
A data mesh is a decentralized data architecture that organizes data by 
business domain—such as marketing, sales or customer service.


Dataplex - "intelligent data fabric"
         - designed to weave together data mgmt across various environments, 
            creating a streamlined and unified way of handling data

         - key functionalities:
            .- unified data management
            .- automated data lifecycle management
            .- integrated analytics

         - combines data cataloging, lineage, governance, and quality monitoring
         - goal is to simplify data landscape across data lakes, warehouses, and databases within org

*exam tip* think of Dataplex when you hear:
                    - "decentralized data management"
                    - "centralized data governance"
                    - "data mesh"

-- Dataplex - Roles and Access Management
-------------------------------

- Unified Access Management

*Gemini*
Dataplex's way to provide a centralized and consistent way to define, manage, and enforce security policies and 
data access controls across a distributed data landscape, without moving the data. 

Dataplex has its own roles that you can assign at the service level

dataplex.dataOwner
dataplex.dataWriter
dataplex.dataReader 

granting Dataplex roles automatically grants access to the data in other services
that are part of the Dataplex-managed data mesh

    e.g. dataplex.dataOwner of a BigQuery dataset can manage the underlying tables

skip managing roles separately in each service

note: there may still be more granular access controls each domain must apply at service level
            (e.g. restrict access to sensitive data in a dataset/table)


- Key Roles in Dataplex

    Dataplex Administrator - full control of all Dataplex resources
    Dataplex Data Owner - Manage data assets in the data mesh
    Dataplex Data Writer - write access to data assets, but no admin privileges
    Dataplex Data Reader - read-only access to data assets in the data mesh
    Dataplex Metadata Reader - metadata only without accessing the data
    Dataplex Viewer - ability to view the mesh and configured zones and assets without accessing data
