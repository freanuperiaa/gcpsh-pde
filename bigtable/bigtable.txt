-- Bigtable Intro
-------------------------------

Bigtable is a high-performance massively scalable NoSQL database
designed for large analytical and operational workloads
good for high throughput data that needs atomicity
managed, but not no-ops. you have to configure the instances etc.

command line tools
    interact with Bigtable data via:
        cbt (Cloud Bigtable Tool)
        HBase shell

    gcloud - used for managing the BigTable service (i.e. instances, tables, clusters)

-- Use Cases
-------------------------------

- Bigtable use cases
    time series data storage (lots of writes per second, sometimes with few columns e.g. stock data)
    geospatial data storage
    real-time content recommendations
    IoT sensor data ingestion

- "Tall and Narrow" tables
    Bigtable is good for tall and narrow tables, large number of rows but relatively few columns
    often seen in use cases that involve high-throughput analytics like stock data, time-series data
    efficient for "needle in a haystack" operations, like reading or writing a specific value within a massive dataset
        - e.g., quickly locating a specific stock price within a years' worth of stock data
