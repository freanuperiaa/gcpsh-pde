-------------------------------
-- BigQuery Omni
-------------------------------

intended to unify multi-cloud analytics
analyze data across GCP, AWS, and Azure without moving data

Key features:
    - SQL queries across clouds
    - seamless integration
    - Data security (Native GCP standards upheld)
    - lower costs (reduces data movement and operational complexity)

*Exam Tip* 
    consider choosing BQ Omni if you are given a scenario where you need to 
    integrate data into BQ from multiple cloud platforms


-------------------------------
-- Analytics Hub
-------------------------------

centralized platform for data sharing and data collaboration

launched in 2021 to adress growing need for data exchange within and between orgs

2 main entities in Analytics Hub setup:
    Publisher Project
        - source datasets owned by the publisher, and the publisher can share access to these datasets by creating
            a shared dataset
    
    Subscriber Project
        - when a subscriber is granted access, they can create a linked dataset in their own
            BQ environment, allowing them to query the published data


- Private Exchange feature
a secure and controlled environment for sharing sensitive data

    - enhanced data privacy
    - controlled access to datasets
    - customizable sharing policies

Private exchange is extremely useful when sharing proprietary data within a company or 
collaborating on sensitive projects with trusted partners


- Exam Scenarios

On the exam, Analytics Hub is likely to show up as the answer when:
    - you are sharing data with another organization
    - you are sharing sensitive data within your organization or a trusted partner.
        you would most likely use Private Exchange with sensitive data


-------------------------------
-- BigLake
-------------------------------

perform analytics regardless where the data is stored (even in other clouds)
"break down data siloes"
another GCP offering for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions

not just analytics, but applying other benefits of BQ
    - fine-grained security
    - performance
    - caching
    - sharing

maintain a single copy of your data wherever it is, and make it accessible across GCP
(using BigLake connectors)

accessible through BQ UI

*Gemini*
BigQuery Omni is a cross-cloud compute engine that runs queries locally on data stored in other clouds 
(like AWS or Azure), while BigLake is a storage engine that provides a unified, governed interface for 
querying data lakes and warehouses across clouds. 

BigQuery Omni enables the compute to run on-site in remote clouds, whereas BigLake is the underlying technology that 
makes it possible to manage and query data from different sources, including those accessed via Omni, 
through a single, governed interface. 


- BigLake Granular Security Policies

you can apply security policies at table, row, column level on BigLake tables, even in other clouds


- BigLake Tables vs BQ External Tables

converting a BQ External table (e.g. GCS) into a BigLake table may improve performance and mgmt
    - BigLake allows you to treat data as native
    - better query performance 
    - more granularity and access control
    - integrated metadata caching
