-------------------------------
-- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API
-------------------------------

powerful for discovering, classifying, and protecting sensitive data
automated data recognition, risk analysis, data redaction, and de-identification
protecting & identifying PII/PHI, and other sensitive info


-------------------------------
-- Data Protection Methods
-------------------------------

- Masking
    replacing parts of the data with asterisks or other characters, while leaving some portions visible
    ideal for scenario where you need to protect sensitive info but need to retain parts of it for reference
    e.g. johndoe123@gmail.com -> jo*******3@g***.**m

- Format-Preserving Encryption
    better for when the data needs to follow a specific format for further processing, but does not need to be
        human-readable for troubleshooting/reference
    
    e.g.
        johndoe123@gmail.com -> edrf195zc@domain.org
            John Doe         ->  Qelk Tir

-- Integration with GCP Services
-------------------------------

Integration with other services

At Rest
    - Cloud Storage: scan and protect unstructured data like text files, CSV, JSON, etc
    - BigQuery: protect sensitive info in tables, such as columns of PII, PHI, or other sensitive data

In Transit
    - Dataflow: apply DLP for real-time and batch data processing in ETL pipelines, before it is stored or processed
    - Pub/Sub: scan and redact sensitive data in event-driven streaming pipelines


The DLP API is easy to integrate into applications and pipelines due to its RESTful API design
and the availability of client libraries in several widely-used programming languages
