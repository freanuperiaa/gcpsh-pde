-- Intro to Cloud Pub/Sub
-------------------------------

Pub/Sub is a global-scale messaging service that allows communication 
between different systems by decoupling senders and receivers


- Publishers & Subscribers

Publisher
    - an entity (application or service) that creates and sends messages
        to Cloud Pub/Sub
    - it doesn't need to know who will receive or process the messages

Subscriber
    - an entity that receives messages from Pub/Sub
    - it tells Pub/Sub that it has received the message and processes it

- Topics and Subscriptions

Topic
    - a named resource to which publishers send messages
    - it acts like a channel or category under which messages are sent

Subscription
    - named resource representing the stream of messages from a specific topic to a subscriber


** Gemini **
A publisher sends a message to a topic, and a subscription is how a subscriber receives messages from that topic. 
The publisher and subscriber are decoupled, meaning the publisher doesn't need to know about the subscribers, 
and the publisher can send messages to the topic without knowing if any subscribers are listening. 
The subscription acts as the intermediary, ensuring messages are delivered to the intended subscribers. 


-------------------------------
-- Push vs Pull Subscriptions
-------------------------------

Push Subscriptions
    - Pub/Sub initiates, sends message to subscriber without waiting for any requests
    - Push subscriptions are better for low latency, real-time streaming use cases
    - subscriber must be a webhook endpoint that accepts POST over HTTPS

Pull Subscription
    - Subscriber initiates, asks Pub/Sub for messages
    - better for batch delivery, large volume of messages
    - usually requires more code
