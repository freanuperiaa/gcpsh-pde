-- Cloud Logging
-------------------------------

enables you to store, search, and analyze log data and events from Google Cloud resources


- Core Log Types

Platform Logs
    - originate from GCP services themselves
Application Logs
    - generated by your own code running in GCP
    - application-specific events and errors, helpful for debugging
Audit Logs
    - user and system activities that have implications for security and compliance


Retention Period for Logs: 30 days (default)
    - though this can be configured to a custom retention period, or can be exported
    - important for compliance and cost management

Log Sinks
    - export destinations for your logs, based on specific filters


-------------------------------
-- Cloud Monitoring
-------------------------------

Collect, analyze, and visualize metrics from GCP resources
keep track of health and performance of your applications and infra
real-time metrics and alerts
can do custom metrics/dashboards



- Types of Cloud Monitoring Metrics

Built-in Metrics
    - Infrastructure (CPU util, disk I/O, network traffic, memory)
    - Application metrics (response times, error rates, request rates, latency)
    - system metrics (system load, running processes)

Custom Metrics
    - User engagement
    - Business Transactions

External Metrics
    - multi-cloud metrics
    - on-prem applications
    - on-prem monitoring tools

- Alerts
    - real-time alerts can be configured on any metrics
        - CPU util exceeding 90%
        - response time threshold
    - once an alert is triggered, it can send notifications to channels (email, SMS, slack, etc)
