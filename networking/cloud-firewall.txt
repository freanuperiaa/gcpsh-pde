-- Cloud Firewall
-------------------------------

allows you to define and enforce rules that control network traffic to and from resources

mainly for VMs
also applies to:
    Load Balancers
    GKE Clusters
    Cloud SQL instances

includes controlling both ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic

- Firewall rules
    act as guards, determining what traffic gets in and out of your VPC
    rule criteria: protocols, IP ranges, ports, and tags, or on identity (service accounts)

    Firewall rules have a "priority" attribute that determines the order in which they are evaluated
        range - [0, 65535]. lower numbers indicate higher priority

    identity-based firewall rules
        when instances/services have svc accts with them, configuring rules based on those svc accts
            can enhance security, as it allows for identity-based access control


- Logging
    firewall rule logging is disabled by default
    to enable logging for a given Firewall rule:
        in config page for the rule, find the "Logs" section, and set the "Logs" option to "On".
        this logs connections that match the firewall rule
