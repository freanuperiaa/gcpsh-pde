-- Cloud NAT
-------------------------------

NAT - Network Address Translation
technology used to map private IP addresses to public IP addresses, 
    which allows communication to external networks

enables VMs without public IP addresses to access the internet (outbound)

*Gemini*
It works by translating the private IP addresses of your instances into a shared public IP address assigned to 
the Cloud NAT gateway, which sits on a Cloud Router. 
This provides secure, managed connectivity without exposing your private instances directly to the internet for 
inbound connections. 

Benefits of Cloud NAT
    - reduces attack surface by not requiring external IPs, preventing unsolicited inbound connections
    - scales automatically
    - high availability
    - lower costs by reducing number of external IP addresses


*Exam Tip* activating Cloud NAT often goes hand-in-hand with disallowing external IPs through the org policy:
