-- Cloud Memorystore
-------------------------------

fully-managed in-memory data store
useful as a caching layer (system that stores frequently accessed data in memory for better performance.)
                          (think of sessions in a website, sumn like dat)

- Use Cases
    news website caching frequently-accessed articles
    API Request caching - frequently accessed endpoint can be cached
    ecommerce platform storing user session (e.g. cart contents)

    *even though its not an analytic database*, Memorystore can be used for dashboard/analytics purposes when
        low latency is required

-- MemCached and Redis
-------------------------------

Redis Tiers
    Basic Tier - cost effective, easy set-up, no high availability mode/failover protection
    Standard Tier - More expensive, requires more config, high availability with automatic failover protection


MemCached vs Redis

* Gemini *
Memorystore for Redis 
    Best for: Use cases beyond simple caching, such as session stores, leaderboards, real-time analytics, and queues.
    Key features: Supports advanced data structures like lists, sets, and hashes. It also offers persistence and high availability through its Standard tier.
    When to choose: When you need more advanced functionality or high availability. 

Memorystore for Memcached 
    Best for: Simple, high-performance caching of database query results or HTML fragments.
    Key features: Highly performant, simple, and widely used for its speed.
    When to choose: When your application's needs are basic and speed is the top priority, and you don't need advanced data structures or persistence. 

How to choose
    Start with your use case: If you're building a new application and need something beyond simple caching, Redis is generally the more powerful and flexible option.
    Consider features: If you need persistence, replication, or advanced data structures, choose Redis. If you just need a fast, simple cache, Memcached may be sufficient.
    Check compatibility: Make sure your application's existing client libraries are compatible with your chosen option.

-- Monitoring Redis
-------------------------------

*Exam* it may be asked when it's time to upgrade Redis?

    - Set up a *Cloud Monitoring Alert* to let you know once the "System Memory Usage Ratio" metric reaches 80%
        this provides the percentage of the total memory being used

        - when this is reached, it is recommended to upgrade to larger instance or higher tier
