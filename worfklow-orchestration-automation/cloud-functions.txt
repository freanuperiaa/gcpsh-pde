most abstracted and lightweight of GCP's compute services
serverless execution env
event-driven code
automatic scaling (limits on execution time and memory/CPU)
GCP version of AWS Lambda

Cloud Run is a serverless platform for running stateless containers, making it suitable for 
full applications, APIs, and longer-running services, while Cloud Functions is ideal for event-driven, 
short-lived functions triggered by specific events, though Google is merging Cloud Functions into Cloud Run. 
Key differences are Cloud Run's support for any language and the ability to handle multiple requests per instance, 
versus Cloud Functions' single-request-per-instance limit and event-specific triggers. 

Use Cases

- execute code automatically in response to specific events
- creating lightweight APIs
- cost is a consideration + sporadic workloads/microservice architectures
- code development focus (no need to care about ops)

Types of Triggers

remember that Cloud Function is event-driven

Triggered by various sources
    - changes in Cloud Storage
    - New messages in Pub/Sub
    - HTTP requests
